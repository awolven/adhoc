# adhoc
Another Declarative Hierarchical Object-centric CLOS Customization. An advanced object oriented extension to CLOS.

Currently supported Lisps:
sbcl, ccl

Based on slots and slot definition metaobjects, Adhoc adds the concept of `attributes' to CLOS.  Attributes are essentially computed slots with dependency tracking.

See the files in the docs/ directory for more details.

Enjoy.
