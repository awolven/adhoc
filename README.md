# adhoc
Another Declarative Hierarchical Object-centric CLOS Customization. An advanced object oriented extension to CLOS.

Currently supported Lisps:
sbcl, ccl

Based on slot and slot definition metaobjects, Adhoc adds the concept of `attributes' to CLOS.  Attributes are essentially computed slots with dependency tracking.  Enjoy.
